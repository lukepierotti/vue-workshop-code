# 1.2 Dependency Tracking

## Goal

- Create a `Dep` class with two methods: `depend` and `notify`.
- Create an `autorun` function that takes an updater function.
- Inside the updater function, you can explicitly depend on an instance of `Dep` by calling `dep.depend()`
- Later, you can trigger the updater function to run again by calling `dep.notify()`.

The full usage should look like this:

``` js
const dep = new Dep()

autorun(() => {
  dep.depend()
  console.log('updated')
})
// should log: "updated"

dep.notify()
// should log: "updated"
```

Hint: the trick is about finding the updater function
being called when `Dep.depend()` is called, and
adding that updater function as a subscriber to the
Dep.

To test if your implementation is correct, run:

``` bash
yarn test 1.2
# or
npm test -- 1.2
```
